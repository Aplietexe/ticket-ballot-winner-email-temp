# ticket-ballot-winner-email-temp

An HTML email template I did as a freelancer. Email HTML is much more limited
than browser HTML, and maintaining compatibility with most email clients
involves quite a bit of adapting.

[Demo live version](https://aplietexe.github.io/ticket-ballot-winner-email-temp/).

For demo purposes, the live version self-hosts images instead of using Google
Maps Static API and an external server for images.
